# Summary

`sweetbean` is an open-source, domain-specific declarative programming language built in Python, designed to simplify the synthesis of web-based behavioral experiments. It allows researchers to specify a behavioral experiment in declarative form as a sequence of events. Once specified, `sweetbean` can compile the experiment into a `jsPsych` experiment [@de2015jspsych] for web-based behavioral study with human participants. In addition, `sweetbean` can generate prompts for conducting the same experiment with a large language model (LLM), enabling automated alignment of LLMs with human behavior.

The `sweetbean` package integrates with other tools that automate aspects of behavioral research, such as `sweetpea` [@musslick2020sweetpea] for automating experimental design, or `autora` [@autora2024] for orchestrating closed-loop behavioral research studies. Together, these tools form an ecosystem for advancing behavioral research through automated scientific discovery.

# Statement of need

The generation and execution of web-based experiments is a common task in the behavioral sciences. However, the process of designing and implementing such experiments can difficult, especially if researchers don't have a background in web development.  While platforms like `jsPsych` offer powerful solutions for running online experiments, they require knowledge of *JavaScript*, which poses a significant barrier for researchers without programming expertise.  Other platforms, like `PsychoPy` [@peirce2019psychopy2], have made significant strides in addressing this issue by providing a graphical user interface for experiment design, along with functionality for exporting executable experiments into Python and JavaScript. However, `PsychoPy` is not specifically tailored for creating online JavaScript experiments, which can result in compatibility issues and unsupported `PsychoPy` components.  `sweetbean` aims to simplify the process of generating online experiments by providing an intuitive declarative language for specifying experiments in Python. By abstracting the details of web development, `sweetbean` enables researchers to concentrate on the specification of the experiment itself, rather than on its implementation details.

Another challenge in behavioral research is the integration of LLMs into the experimental workflow. LLMs have the potential to simulate human behavior in a variety of tasks, making them valuable simulators for behavioral experiments [@dillion2023can; @manning2024automated; @binz2024centaur]. Accordingly, researchers are increasingly interested in aligning the behavior of LLMs with human participants, calling for the development of tools that facilitate this alignment. `sweetbean` addresses this challenge by providing a way to generate prompts for LLMs based on the same experiment specification used to generate web-based experiments for human participants. This allows researchers to easily generate synthetic behavioral data with LLMs, compare the behavior of LLMs to human participants, and to align LLMs with human behavior.

Beyond reducing technical barriers and facilitating alignment between machines and humans, `sweetbean` enhances reproducibility and collaboration by standardizing experiment specifications within a flexible and intuitive framework. This standardization not only saves time but also provides more robust and scalable experimental workflows for the behavioral research community.
