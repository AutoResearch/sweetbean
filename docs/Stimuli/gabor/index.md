# Gabor

Render one or more procedural Gabor patches on a canvas and collect keyboard and/or mouse responses. Each patch is defined by position, size (sigma), spatial frequency, orientation, phase, and contrast. Supports pixel or degree units (via px_per_deg). Overlapping patches are allowed.

## When To Use

- 2AFC/left–right discrimination with Gabors (e.g., “which side is higher contrast?”).
- Orientation / contrast / phase judgments with one or multiple patches.
