"""
A welcoming text the participant is shown until the participant presses the spacebar. The text says,
'Welcome! We show a survey. Press SPACE to continue'. This is followed by a survey with two
questions that the participant is supposed to answer on a likert scale. The first question is
'How are you feeling?' and the participant is supposed to rate their feeling on a scale from
-2 to 2 with 5 levels. The second question is 'Do you like this tool?' on a scale from 1 to 3.
Then, the participant is supposed to rate five animals on their cuteness from 1 to 5.
The animals are a bunny, a shark, a spider, a cat, and a dog.
