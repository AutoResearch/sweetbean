# RSVP

Present one or more rapid serial visual presentation streams where items appear in quick succession. Participants detect or identify target items among distractors, optionally responding via keyboard. You can control stream layout (row/column), order, item timing (duration/ISI), masks, and trial duration.

## When To Use

- Attentional blink or target detection in fast streams.
- Dual-stream (left/right) RSVP with synchronized or offset sequences.
- Rapid sequences where precise item timing and ordering matter.
