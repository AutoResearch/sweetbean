# HtmlChoice

Render multiple on-screen HTML elements as clickable options. A mouse or touch click selects one item; the stimulus
records the selected index (`choice`) and, if provided, an associated `value`. An optional post-response delay lets
short animations or visual confirmation play before the trial ends.

## When To Use

- On-screen alternatives presented as buttons, icons, or custom HTML.
- Mouse/touch tasks where the participant chooses one of several items.
- Post-stimulus decision screens following another presentation phase.
