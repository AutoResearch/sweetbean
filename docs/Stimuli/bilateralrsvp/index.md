# BilateralRSVP

Present two synchronized RSVP streams (left and right) where one item per side appears each frame. Participants detect or identify a target on one stream (by feature/shape or content) while the opposite stream can carry a simultaneous distractor. You control per-frame timing (duration/ISI), per-side item sequences, optional masks, target/distractor annotations (shape/underline), keyboard response handling, and overall trial duration.

## When To Use

- Classic leftâ€“right RSVP with a single target per trial.
- Shape-/feature-defined targets (e.g., circle vs. square) with optional post-target distractors.
- Lateralized EEG/ERP paradigms (e.g., N2pc) needing stable bilateral placement.
- Two-alternative forced-choice or identification tasks following rapid bilateral streams.
