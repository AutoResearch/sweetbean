# Image

Display a static image file on screen. Optionally collect a keyboard response while the image is visible (e.g., specific keys like `["f","j"]`) and compute reaction time.

## When To Use

- Trials that present a pre-made picture/figure/photo as the main stimulus.
- Your data has a column with image file paths or identifiers to show per trial.
- You need a simple keypress response during or after image presentation.

## Example: Banana

A banana is shown until the participant presses space.
