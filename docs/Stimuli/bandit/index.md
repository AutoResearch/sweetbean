# Bandit

Present a grid of colored squares representing multiple “bandits.” The participant clicks a square to choose one option.
The stimulus records the selected index (`choice`) and a corresponding `value` (e.g., payout/label). The layout adapts
to the number of bandits, and a short post-response delay can drive simple animations before the trial ends.

## When To Use

- Multi-armed bandit tasks with several simultaneous options.
- Reward/payout choice screens where each option has an associated value.
- Visual grids of clickable alternatives.

## Examples

A three-armed bandit task for reinforcement learning. The task is to choose between options, each with a different
value.
