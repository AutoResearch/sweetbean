# HtmlKeyboardResponse

Display arbitrary HTML content and collect **keyboard** responses from a specified key set. Records the pressed key and reaction time (RT). An optional `correct_key` lets you mark correctness for downstream feedback.

## When To Use

- You want to show HTML (text, simple markup, etc.) and capture a keypress.
- Response prompts that require a specific key set (e.g., ["f","j"]).
- As the response phase following another stimulus.
