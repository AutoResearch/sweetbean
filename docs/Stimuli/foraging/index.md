# Foraging

Display an on-screen arena containing multiple items with a subset designated as **targets** and the rest as *
*distractors**. Participants click targets to collect them. The trial typically ends when all targets are collected or
when a time limit is reached. Layouts can be randomized or arranged (grid/circle), items avoid overlap, and tokens can
be HTML, text, simple shapes, or images.

## When To Use

- Multi-target visual search / foraging with click-to-collect responses.
- You need control over target/distractor counts, spacing, placement mode, and timing.
- You care about search efficiency metrics (e.g., targets per second), click streams, and completion rate.
