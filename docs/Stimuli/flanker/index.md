# Flanker

Show a central target arrow flanked by distractor arrows (e.g., `<<><<`, `>><>>`). Participants respond to the targetâ€™s direction via keypress while flankers may be congruent or incongruent.

## When To Use

- Arrow-based Flanker tasks (congruent vs. incongruent).
- Response interference paradigms with left/right keys.
- Quick attentional control or conflict measurements.
