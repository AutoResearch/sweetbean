# SweetBean

SweetBean is an
open-source [domain-specific programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) in Python,
designed for the declarative specification of stimuli sequences and the synthesis of online [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/) behavioral experiments. With SweetBean,
researchers can conveniently specify experiments once and then compile them into a jsPsych experiment for **human participants** or text-based experiment for **synthetic
participants** (e.g., large-language models).

## Why SweetBean?

In recent years, crowdsourced online experiments have gained immense popularity across behavioral sciences like
cognitive psychology, social psychology, and behavioral economics. These experiments offer several advantages, such as:

- Faster data collection: gather large datasets in a fraction of the time required for in-person studies at the lab.
- Increased accessibility: access participants from diverse populations globally.

Despite these benefits, the process of designing and implementing online experiments remains time-consuming and
error-prone. Existing tools like [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/latest/) have made strides in simplifying this
process, but there's still a need for a more intuitive solution, in particular for researchers who don't have a background in programming in JavaScript. We address this need with SweetBean.

- Declarative language in Python: easily specify the structure and flow of experiments, even with minimal programming experience.
- Synthetic participant support: Integrate [large-language models as synthetic participants](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661323000980) for pilot studies, generating synthetic data
  to test hypotheses or fine-tune models.

## SweetBean is Growing

![word-cloud](img/word-cloud.png){:.center}
Our philosophy is rooted in continuous evolution and user-driven development. The initial set of features was based on a
word cloud to identify frequently used features of behavioral experiments, but we are always adding new features and stimuli based on the needs of
our team and collaborators. If you have any suggestions or feature requests, please feel free to reach out to us via
e-mail ([ystrittmatter@princeton.edu](mailto: ystrittmatter@princeton.edu)) or create an issue on our GitHub repository
([https://github.com/AutoResearch/sweetbean/issues](https://github.com/AutoResearch/sweetbean/issues)). We are
constantly seeking feedback and looking for ways to improve the language.

## Automated Documentation

SweetBean is designed with automated documentation in mind. The declarative nature of the language is specifically designed to enable automated translations between code and natural language. Additionally, SweetBean can generate images of stimulus sequences, which may serve as figures in the method section of a paper.

## When Things Go Wrong

SweetBean is a work in progress, and we are constantly working to improve the language and its documentation. 

However, sometimes the resulting JavaScript code from a SweetBean experiment might not work as expected. The first step to troubleshoot such issues is to check the generated JavaScript code itself. In most cases, a syntax error in the JavaScript code is the root cause of the problem. If you identify such an issue, we encourage you to open an issue on our GitHub repository and include both the SweetBean code causing the issue and the translation.

If there is no syntax error, but the code is still not running as expected, you might want to try to debug your code. You can use the browser's developer tools to identify the issue. If you are not familiar with debugging JavaScript code, we recommend checking out the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript) for a comprehensive guide on JavaScript debugging. If you think there is a bug in SweetBean, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.

## Discover More from Our Suite of Tools

SweetBean is just one part of a powerful set of tools designed to streamline and enhance the behavioral research process. It can be used as a standalone product but is most powerful when used in conjunction with our other tools:

- [SweetPea](https://sweetpea.ai/): A Python toolbox for the automated generation of **counterbalanced experimental designs** with similar syntax as SweetBean. Create complex counterbalanced trial sequences with SweetPea and then use SweetBean to implement them in online experiments.

- [AutoRA](https://autoresearch.github.io/autora/): A Python platform for **automated behavioral research**, helping you design, execute and analyze behavioral experiments in a closed loop. Experiments created with SweetBean can be implemented via AutoRA to collect data from human participants. Even if you are not planning to automate your research in a closed loop, AutoRA can help you set up and run experiments without the need of your own server and collect data from real participants via [Prolific](https://www.prolific.com/).
