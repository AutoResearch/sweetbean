# SweetBean

A declarative programming language built in Python, designed for the synthesis of behavioral experiments. It allows researchers to specify experiments once and seamlessly compile them into a [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/) experiment for conducting studies with human participants or text-based simulations with synthetic participants using large-language models. 

## Features

- **Declarative language**: Specify experiments once and compile them into a jsPsych experiment for conducting studies with **human participants** or text-based simulations with **synthetic participants** using large-language models.
- **Python-based**: SweetBean is built in Python, making it accessible and easy to use for researchers and educators.

## Integrate with other packages

This package seamlessly integrates with other packages aimed at running online behavioral experiments:

- [AutoRA](https://autoresearch.github.io/autora/): For closed loop research, automatic experiment deployment, participant recruitment, and data collection.
- [SweetPea](http://sweetpea.ai/): For experimental design.

But it can also be used as a standalone product.

## Installation

The package is available on PyPI and can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install sweetbean
```
